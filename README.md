# BINF6110 Assignment 1: Using Bioinformatic Research Tools to Assemble the Bacterial Genome of *Salmonella enterica* 
## Introduction

Bacterial infections constitute a major public health burden and are responsible for significant levels of morbidity and mortality across human and animal populations. [1, 2] The diverse host invasion strategies employed by pathogenic bacteria, together with the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance, highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial virulence and host-pathogen interactions. Advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies, coupled with modern bioinformatics tools, have substantially facilitated bacterial genome analysis. [2] The availability of high-quality, accurately reconstructed genomes is essential for these analyses, emphasizing genome assembly as a fundamental step in bacterial genomics. [3]

*Salmonella enterica* is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium with more than 2,600 distinct serovars. [4, 5] As a highly adaptable environmental microorganism, it occupies a wide range of reservoirs and represents a major pathogen of both humans and animals. Human infection can result in salmonellosis, which may be severe or, in some cases, fatal [6]. The *S. enterica* genome is approximately 4.8 Mb in size and is characterized by high gene density and the presence of diverse mobile genetic elements, including plasmids and prophages. [7, 8] Given its significant public health relevance and extensive serovar diversity, S. enterica is a well-suited model for bacterial genome assembly and comparative genomic analyses. Furthermore, numerous high-quality, well-annotated reference genomes are publicly available, allowing for effective validation of assembled genomes. [7]

Reconstructing a bacterial genome from sequencing reads requires technologies capable of achieving high sequence coverage, minimal fragmentation, and sufficient accuracy, while also maintaining short turnaround times to accommodate rapid bacterial evolution. [9, 10]  Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10 sequencing has enabled the generation of near-complete microbial genomes with coverage exceeding 40-fold, in some cases without the need for additional short-read polishing. [11] Furthermore, ONT sequencing is rapid and efficient, supporting real-time base calling and analysis, which is particularly advantageous for time-sensitive applications such as outbreak response.[12] Despite these advantages, ONT-derived assemblies may exhibit systematic base-calling errors, particularly at methylated genomic positions, and long reads can span highly repetitive regions that complicate accurate assembly. [10, 13] To mitigate these limitations, post-assembly polishing strategies are commonly employed to improve consensus accuracy and produce high-quality microbial genome assemblies. [14] 

Before the advent of autonomous long-read assemblers, bacterial genome assembly was labour-intensive and limited in its ability to resolve repetitive genomic regions. [15] Flye was developed as an automated de novo assembler optimized for long-read sequencing data, enabling efficient and accurate genome reconstruction. The tool employs a repeat graph–based approach to resolve repetitive regions and generate contiguous genome assemblies [13]. Comparative studies have shown that Flye generates more accurate and contiguous assemblies than other state-of-the-art single-molecule sequencing assemblers, while also effectively reconstructing mosaic segmental duplication structures.¹³ Despite these advantages, base-calling errors introduced during Oxford Nanopore sequencing can propagate into the initial assembly. Post-assembly polishing tools address these residual errors, improving overall accuracy to levels comparable with short-read sequencing approaches. [14] Among Nanopore polishing methods, Medaka has been shown to produce high-quality, low-error genomes suitable for downstream analyses. [14]

Once a high-quality consensus genome has been assembled and polished, comparison to a well-annotated reference genome enables the identification and characterization of sequence variation.[16] Alignment to a reference strain facilitates the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which are essential for understanding strain-level differences and evolutionary processes in bacterial genomes.[16] For reference-based mapping of long-read sequencing data, minimap2 is widely regarded as a benchmark method.[17] It employs a seed–chain–align strategy to map long sequencing reads to reference genomes, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency relative to other domain-specific alignment tools.[18] Although minimap2 enables efficient alignment of large-scale genomic datasets, the resulting alignments can be challenging to interpret without visualization. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) addresses this by using efficient, multi-resolution file formats that support real-time exploration of large genomic datasets with minimal computational expense. [19] 

This study evaluates a computational pipeline for bacterial genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore R10 sequencing data to assemble and polish a Salmonella enterica genome, followed by reference-based comparison to identify and visualize sequence variation.

## Methods
### Sequencing Data Acquisition
Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads generated using R10 chemistry (expected accuracy Q20+, N50: 5–15 kb) were retrieved in FASTQ format from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive using the SRA Toolkit (accession SRR32410565). Raw reads were used directly for downstream analyses to avoid reference bias. Read length and quality distributions were evaluated using seqtk summary statistics to confirm suitability for long-read genome assembly. Overall sequencing quality was further assessed using FastQC, which generated summary metrics including per-base sequence quality, GC content, sequence duplication levels, and potential adapter contamination.

### Genome Assembly
De novo genome assembly was performed using Flye (v2.9.2), an autonomous long-read assembler optimized for error-prone single-molecule sequencing data such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore sequencing. [13] Assembly was conducted using the --nano-hq parameter to specify high-quality Nanopore input reads, while all other parameters were retained at default settings to minimize manual bias. Flye employs a repeat graph-based assembly approach, enabling effective resolution of repetitive genomic regions and the generation of contiguous genome assemblies. Assembly quality was evaluated using QUAST [20], which provides metrics such as N50, total assembly length, and contiguity, and BUSCO [21], which assesses genome completeness based on the presence of conserved single-copy orthologs. 

### Assembly Polishing
To improve consensus accuracy and mitigate base-calling errors associated with Oxford Nanopore sequencing, post-assembly polishing was performed using Medaka (v1.7.3) [14]. Medaka applies neural network–based models trained on Oxford Nanopore data to correct systematic sequencing errors. The appropriate Medaka model corresponding to R10 chemistry was selected (r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v5.0.0), and polishing was conducted using default settings to refine the assembled genome before downstream analyses. The polished assembly was reassessed using QUAST and BUSCO to evaluate improvements in contiguity, completeness, and overall assembly quality resulting from polishing.

### Reference Genome Selection
To determine the most appropriate Salmonella enterica reference genome, the first 1,000,000 bases of contig_1 from the Flye assembly were extracted and used as the query sequence for an NCBI nucleotide BLAST analysis. A high-quality, well-annotated Salmonella enterica reference genome (NCBI Assembly ASM694v2) was retrieved from the NCBI Assembly database [7]. This reference genome was selected based on its BLAST similarity scores, completeness and annotation quality, providing a reliable framework for comparative analyses and variant detection.

### Read Alignment to Reference Genome
Polished sequencing reads were aligned to the reference genome using minimap2 (v2.26), a widely used and benchmarked aligner for long-read sequencing data [17]. Alignments were performed in two steps: first, raw reads were aligned to the reference genome for variant calling using the -ax map-ont preset, which is optimized for Oxford Nanopore reads and balances alignment accuracy with computational efficiency; second, the assembled genome was aligned to the reference genome for structural analysis using the -ax asm5 preset, optimized for assembly-to-assembly alignments. Resulting alignments were stored in BAM format for downstream analyses. The polished and assembled *Salmonella enterica* genome was annotated using Prokka, a software tool for rapid prokaryotic genome annotation. [22] Genome synteny between the polished and assembled genomes and the reference genome was visualized using a SYNY Circos plot, which infers collinearity from pairwise genome alignments generated with minimap2. [23] 

### Variant Identification and Visualization
Aligned reads were used to identify sequence variation between the assembled genome and the reference genome. Variants of interest included single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which provide insight into strain-level differences and evolutionary divergence.[16] Genomic alignments and detected variants were ​​visualized using bcftools and IGV (v2.16.2) to enable interactive inspection of alignments and variants [19, 24]

## Results

### Sequencing Data Quality and Characteristics
Seqtk and FastQC analyses indicated that 196,031 Nanopore reads were obtained, totalling 809.2 Mbp of sequence data. Read lengths ranged from 9 to 58,041 bases, with an overall GC content of 52%. No significant adaptor contamination or overrepresented sequences were detected, and sequence duplication levels were minimal. The Salmonella enterica Nanopore reads had an average Phred quality score greater than 30, consistent with high-quality sequence data.

### Reference Genome Identification and De Novo Genome Assembly Metrics 
De novo assembly with Flye produced four contigs totalling 5,147,510 bp. The first 1,000,000 bases of contig_1 were extracted and used as the query for an NCBI nucleotide BLAST search, which returned a 99.99% identity match to the Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 complete genome (NCBI Assembly ASM694v2). The alignment exhibited 96% query coverage and an E-value of 0, indicating a highly significant match, and was therefore selected as the reference genome for downstream analyses. (Figure 1)
